Redesign of the classic Pokemon game

This is my second attempt at a redesign of the Pokemon game. The first attempt I lacked the skill required to make such an intensive game such as Pokemon.
During my first year of college, I have learned a lot of new tricks, but the biggest improvement has been in my object oriented approach. I want to take
my newly learned skills as a such to attempt a massive project that will definetly use my old skills while teaching me new skills. This time the project
is also in a faster langauge. It isn't going to be on C++ levels of speed, but it will be faster than my first attempt which was in python.
